# Star Notary - A Decentralized Application(DApp)

A Tokenized Star Notary smart contract with the ERC-721 standard token STN(Star Notary) is deployed to the Rinkeby Public Test network.

The frontend hosted on the server allows anyone to create and own their star using a unique tokenId and also lookup the owned stars.

When a star is created using the DApp, a new STN token is added to the user's wallet which is an NFT(Non Fungible Token).

## How is the ERC-721 token made?

This Token's smart contract is written in solidity with the help of OpenZeppelin library and Truffle is used to compile and deploy to the Ethereum's public test network called Rinkeby.

## What is the contract address of this token?

The contract address of this token is 0x94C13654942876cE5e45bB11CBeD1aa66BFa6E52 and it is deployed to the Ethereum's Public Test Network called Rinkeby

## How to own a star and get a STN token?

This token's contract address can be used to view/add this token on your Ethereum wallet in the Rinkeby Test Network.

Clone this repository and run it on a local server and make sure the wallet is connected.

Using the frontend, you can create a new STN token for yourself and lookup its details.
